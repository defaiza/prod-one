# Security Cleanup Summary

## ðŸš¨ Critical Actions Completed

### 1. âœ… Removed Exposed Secrets File
- Removed `.env.local.backup` from git tracking
- Deleted file from filesystem
- Committed removal to prevent further exposure
- File contained: OAuth credentials, API keys, NextAuth secret

### 2. âœ… Updated .gitignore
- Added `*.backup` pattern
- Added `.env.*` wildcard pattern
- Prevents future accidental commits of sensitive files

### 3. âœ… Secured Critical Endpoints
- **`/api/check-airdrop`**: Added rate limiting + auth for DB updates
- **`/api/referrals/register`**: Now requires full authentication
- **`/api/referrals/get-code`**: Auth required for creating new users

## ðŸ”´ URGENT: Actions Still Required

### 1. ROTATE ALL EXPOSED CREDENTIALS (DO NOW!)
The exposed `.env.local.backup` contained these secrets that MUST be rotated:

#### X/Twitter OAuth (CRITICAL)
```
X_CLIENT_SECRET=jjALyDZh1KUKL5G1J8el0bKQhl7RMjbkTeGvsaW3gkAlwkm_xg
X_API_SECRET=QiOIgkfxe9YADRxuHRfHdg3ELdSwQNVAR2RGgtge8jDxOrpqfS
```
â†’ Go to https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps

#### NextAuth Secret (CRITICAL)
```
NEXT_AUTH_SECRET=EQzMmDue76Q7G25+HojrbUs5p5WkmLU5a2NkmKgy1+32
```
â†’ Generate new: `openssl rand -base64 32`

#### Other Exposed Keys
- Fleek JWT Token
- Multiple UUID API keys
- Chromatic project token

### 2. MongoDB Investigation
Based on our findings:
- No suspicious activity in last 24 hours
- Billing spike likely from:
  - Unprotected endpoints being exploited earlier
  - Quest lifecycle running every minute (1,440 queries/day)
  - Missing indexes causing full collection scans

### 3. Deploy Security Fixes
```bash
# Push the security updates
git push origin main

# Update production environment variables with new secrets
# Deploy immediately
```

### 4. Additional Endpoints to Secure
Still unprotected:
- `/api/agents/deploy`
- `/api/agents/[agentId]/status`
- `/api/users/leaderboard`
- `/api/users/points`
- `/api/squads/leaderboard`

## ðŸ“Š Security Report Summary

Your devops found:
- **14 exposed secrets** in `.env.local.backup`
- **Multiple API endpoints without authentication**
- **No rate limiting** on public endpoints
- **Critical vulnerabilities** in dependency versions

## ðŸ“‹ Complete Security Checklist

- [x] Remove `.env.local.backup` from git
- [x] Update .gitignore
- [x] Add rate limiting middleware
- [x] Secure check-airdrop endpoint
- [x] Secure referrals endpoints
- [ ] **ROTATE ALL CREDENTIALS**
- [ ] Deploy security fixes
- [ ] Add indexes to MongoDB
- [ ] Reduce cron frequency
- [ ] Enable MongoDB IP whitelist
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts
- [ ] Review remaining unprotected endpoints
- [ ] Update vulnerable dependencies

## ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY

1. **ROTATE CREDENTIALS NOW** - Anyone with git history access has your secrets
2. **Deploy secured endpoints** - Stop ongoing attacks
3. **Contact MongoDB support** - Request billing adjustment

Remember: The exposed backup file may have been in your git history for weeks/months. Assume all those credentials are compromised and rotate them immediately!
